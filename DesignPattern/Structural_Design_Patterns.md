# Adapter

Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate


# Bridge

Lets your split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two seperate
hierarchies-abstraction and implementation-which can be develped independently of
each other.


# Composite

Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as
if they were indifidual objects.
