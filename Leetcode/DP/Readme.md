# What is Dynamic Programming

It is very useful when you try to search the optimal solution from some redundant 
sub-problems. To avoid re-calculating again and again these sub-problems, their
results are stored and reused during the process.

So DP can only be used for problems with **optimal substructure**. It means the
gloabl/final optimal solution is related with local/subproblem's optimal solution.

The key of solving DP problems is to find the state transition function.

The way of optimization may be compress the space complexity from 2d to 1d.
